This Project is implementing dataframes using pandas. We have performed many operations like checking for null, replacing the values in data.

we Found the correlation between ‘survived’ (target column) and ‘sex’ column for the Titanic use case in class
We have plotted the histogram and bar chart.
Implemented Naïve Bayes method using scikit-learn library and reported the accuracy.
For the glass data set we found naive bayes is more accurate than SVM dependind on the acuracy parameter
